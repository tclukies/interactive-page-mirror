# JavaScript DOM Selection and Mutation

In this exercise, you'll need to solve a set of exercises aimed at helping you master selecting and mutating the DOM. You may use Vanilla JS or jQuery, but be consistent.

### Setup

Open the `part1.html` file in your web browser.

In your web browser, you'll see a page that shows a bunch of failing JavaScript tests. Locate the area that shows how many tests are passing and how many are failing.

### How to proceed

Your job is to make all these JavaScript tests pass by completing their respective puzzle.

1.  Open the `part1.js` file in your text editor. This is the only file you'll be working in for this drill.
2.  Read the instructions for each exercise.
3.  Solve the exercise by writing JavaScript.
4.  Refresh the 'part1.html' page in your browser to see the passing/failing tests.

### Submitting

Take a screenshot of all passing tests! Include that picture in the version-1 directory, along with your completed code.
