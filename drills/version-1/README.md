## Tic-Tac-Toe

This drill involves making a tic-tac-toe game. The game logic is already written- you just need to do the DOM manipulation to make the game display correctly.

## Instructions

In the `app.js` file:

* Write a function called `createGame` that populates the element with the ID of `gameboard` with the items in the `board` array, so that it looks like ![Game Board](./screenshots/game-board.png)
  * As you create each element, pass them to a pre-built function named `addClickListener`
* Write a function called `displayMessage` that takes an optional message string:
  * Looks up an element with the class `message`
  * Sets the text of the element to the message if it's present
  * Sets the text of the elemnt to the current player otherwise
* Write a function called `changeMessage` that adds the class `end-message` to the element with the class `message` (it should keep the `message` class)
* Write a function called `makeMove` that takes a square element and an index, and update the square at that index with the name of the current player.
